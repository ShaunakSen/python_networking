import urllib
fhand = urllib.urlopen('http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt')

for line in fhand:
    print line.strip()


Urllib allows to read from url like files

counts = dict()

for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
print counts


We are basically doing what?
in web browser we issue a GET req. browser serves us html. we click on a link to
issue another request.....
Here we are doing same stuff but with python program
so we have captchas and all to distinguish between the 2


WEB SERVICES

they send data in - XML and JSON

main problem here is that java has hash maps. python has dictionaries
We need something that both of them can agree upon and then they convert
We call this the wire protocol

Python Dictionary ->(serialize)->Wire Format ->(de serialize)-> Java HashMap

serialize: int structure -> wire format
de serialize: reverse

it allows us to create sets of apps that work in diff languages
Wire Format -> XML and JSON
Note: in microsoft the trailing x ie .pptx means xml as they use xml to represent meta data


XML validator takes in an XML doc and a contract and decides if it is valid or not


Official dateTime formal
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ
Z->Time zone

This is bcoz in this format sorting is natural
ISRO 8601 format

Parsing XML in Python

We have some XML data

data = '''
<person>
    <name>Mini</name>
    <phone type="intl">
        8609131604
    </phone>
    <email hide="yes"/>
</person>
'''

This data is nothing but a String(Important)


Now we have a library xml.etree.ElementTree

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

we parse the string

tree = ET.fromstring(data)

this tree is an object
we can now run methods on this object to scrape out the underlying data
print 'Name:', tree.find('name').text
print 'Attr:', tree.find('email').get('hide')


JSON

import json

data = '''
{
  "name": "Mini",
  "phone": {
    "type": "intl"
    "number": "8609131604"
  },
  "email": {
    "hide": "yes"
  }
}
'''

info = json.loads(data)
loads => load from string
now this returns a PYTHON dictionary!! wow..
